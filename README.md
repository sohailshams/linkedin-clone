# LinkedIn-Clone

## Description

LinkedIn-Clone is a dynamic project designed to sharpen my skills in Next.js/React.js, and TypeScript. The application integrates smooth user authentication through Clerk, enabling users to log in effortlessly via Gmail. Once authenticated, users can create and delete posts, engage with content by liking, disliking, and commenting, and even upload images to enrich their posts. This project highlights my ability to build interactive, feature rich web applications, creating a user friendly and immersive experience.
